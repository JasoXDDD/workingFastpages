Picture Encoding . Essential Question: What are some methods that we could store and access images in the backend, and how can we send them to a frontend application? . The image encoding process for this project is done within the endpoints created on our backend application. The overarching process is split into three seperate sub-processes, each handling a different level of game-difficulty. For this lesson, we will look at the easy images sub-process as our example. . def get_random_easy_image(): images = Images.query.filter_by(_difficulty=0).all() image = random.choice(images) return image . This procedure is a void function that takes in no arguments directly, but does access the database via the Images object imported from the models that we created . The first line filters all database entries and searches for all image entries with the difficulty column set to 0, which we established as the identifying factor for easy images. The .all() method attached to the end of the query serves to return all matching image objects in a list called image. . The procedure finally returns a random image using the random.choice method. . class ImagesAPI: class _EasyImages(Resource): def get(self): image = get_random_easy_image() json_data = {} if image: image_path = project_path + &quot;/&quot; + image.imagePath with open(image_path, &quot;rb&quot;) as image_file: json_data[&quot;bytes&quot;] = str(base64.b64encode(image_file.read()))[2:][:-1] json_data[&quot;xCoord&quot;] = image.xCoord json_data[&quot;yCoord&quot;] = image.yCoord return jsonify(json_data) . If the first procedure locates and selects the image, the second procedure then encodes, formats, and returns the JSON data containing the image and its metadata. . The procedure first calls the get_random_easy_image() procedure created earlier to store our image object and also initializes an empty dictionary to store our json data. . If a valid image object is found, the procedure will attempt to create an absolute path to the image file on the computer running flask application. This is achieved by concatenating the absolute path of the working project directory to the relative image path stored in the database. The aboslute path of the directory is generated in our namespace package (__init__.py) in our _nighthawkguessr_api_ package. The line calculating the project path is shown below, and uses the Path object from the pathlib library. . project_path = Path.cwd().as_posix() . After creating the image path, the procedure attempts to open the image file, and procedes to use the base64.b64encode method to encode the image file bytes into base64 data. This is convinient for us as HTML on the frontend pages allows us to render images with base64 bytes (Not sure about normal image bytes). The base64 bytes are then encoded into a python literal string in order to be jsonified and displayed on the api endpoint. The [2:][:-1] appended to the end is a type of string slicing which removes the b&#39; generated at the start of the data and the &#39; generated at the end of the data. These extraneous characters are used to indicate a base64 string, and are not part of the original data. . The procedure finally appends the metadata (position of the right coordinates on the map) to the json_data dictionary, completing the process. . Finally, the procedure returns the JSONified data, which is accessible from our API. As you can see, the images we process are extremely large and possess high resolution (typically a few megabytes!) . Popcorn Hack: . Please write a few sentences answering the essential question, &quot;What are some methods that we could store and access images in the backend, and how can we send them to a frontend application?&quot; . - . Endpoints . What are endpoints and how do we use them to transfer data from one part of the internet to another? . Backend: . The backend creates endpoints that are used to edit the properties of the database constructed by the model. | ___GET_, _PUT___, _POST___, and _DELETE___ methods are used in order to define HTTP endpoints in the API. These endpoints are based on requests that can be made to __ the database. | Variables defined in the __ file are used to call data from the database in order to be manipulated. | . | . Methods in Backend Example . Modules are being imported with specified classes which are used later in the program. Blueprint: used to organize route__ and functions | request: used to access data sent to the Flask app. through the HTTP request | Api: creates a Flask instance that handles requests | Resource: this allows for the definition of custom HTTP requests | reqparse: used to parse__ (sort and search) and validate data that is requested | . | The blueprint and api are then defined as variables and are used to store any future data__ that is requested. | Some preliminary functions, such as find_by_username, are created to be used later in the API code, allowing for progamatic access to__ code. In this case, these functions are used to search through the database to find specific usernames. | . | . from flask import Blueprint, request from flask_restful import Api, Resource, reqparse # setting variables used to store future data leaderboard_bp = Blueprint(&quot;leaderboards&quot;, __name__) leaderboard_api = Api(leaderboard_bp) # pre-made function created to search for usernames, allows for simplified program def find_by_username(username): users = Leaderboard.query.filter_by(_username=username).all() return users[0] . GET Method . This method is used to __ specific data points from the database by searching through the usernames. | This will be different for each type of database being made, however the general format stays the same. Since this is a text database, to pull specific information from the database, the API will __ through the data using the username, which is unique. | The function defined previously, find_by_username(), is used to search through the database and pull the specific data point that is being searched. | If the user exists, the data of that user will be returned, being sent to the __ of the program. | If a user isn&#39;t found, an error will be returned that the user does not exist. | . | In general, the program will always be searching for a piece of information that is unique and that will be used to pull data to wherever it is being requested. | . def get(self): # requested username turned into variable for later use username = request.get_json().get(&quot;username&quot;) print(username, &quot;uid&quot;) # username used to search for data and the found data is made into a variable user = find_by_username(username) if user: # data is sent to the frontend return user.to_dict() # error checking return {&quot;message&quot;: user}, 404 . POST Method . This method is used to add__ a specific piece of information in the database based on searching by usernames. | This is again different for each database that is made, however the general structure stays the same. In this example, a parser is being used to extract data from an incoming __. In this case, the RequestParser class is used from the Flask module. All required arguments are added to the parser, specifying what type of data it is. | The ____ variable is added in order to parse and store all incoming data. | . | The variable leaderboard is created to make a new object that will contain the values from the incoming data. | The function will attempt to add a new entry in the leaderboard database and return a status of a successful addition of the data. | If there is an error in the data being inputted, a status code of __ will be returned. | . | . def post(self): # using parsers to gather and data that is to be posted and validate it&#39;s true parser = reqparse.RequestParser() parser.add_argument(&quot;username&quot;, required=True, type=str) parser.add_argument(&quot;password&quot;, required=True, type=str) parser.add_argument(&quot;pointsEasy&quot;, required=True, type=int) parser.add_argument(&quot;pointsMedium&quot;, required=True, type=int) parser.add_argument(&quot;pointsHard&quot;, required=True, type=int) # variable made to store data args = parser.parse_args() # variable created to format all data into one place and send to database for logging leaderboard = Leaderboard(args[&quot;username&quot;], args[&quot;password&quot;], args[&quot;pointsEasy&quot;], args[&quot;pointsMedium&quot;], args[&quot;pointsHard&quot;]) try: # data is sent to the database for storage db.session.add(leaderboard) db.session.commit() return leaderboard.to_dict(), 201 except Exception as e: # error checking db.session.rollback() return {&quot;message&quot;: f&quot;server error: {e}&quot;}, 500 . PUT Method . This method is used to __ a specific piece of information in the database based on searching by usernames. | For each data base that is made, there will be different specific but the overall structure stays the same. First, the username variable is defined, which __ the requested username and sets it as a variable that will be used later to edit a specific dataset. | The function find_by_username() is again used to search through the data to look for the username requested. This is set to a variable to be used later. | If the username is found in the database, the rest of the dataset is updated with the new __ requested. This is updated into the database. | If there is an error found with the data requested of it the user isn&#39;t found, an error is returned. | . | . def put(self): # variable created to make requested username into something that can be used to search for data in future username = request.get_json().get(&quot;username&quot;) print(username, &quot;uid&quot;) try: # attempts to find the data in the database user = find_by_username(username) if user: # if the data is found, the data points are updates user.pointsEasy = int(request.get_json().get(&quot;pointsEasy&quot;)) user.pointsMedium = int(request.get_json().get(&quot;pointsMedium&quot;)) user.pointsHard = int(request.get_json().get(&quot;pointsHard&quot;)) db.session.commit() return user.to_dict(), 201 else: # if user not found, error is returned return {&quot;message&quot;: &quot;leaderboard not found&quot;}, 404 except Exception as e: # checks for errors in request db.session.rollback() return {&quot;message&quot;: f&quot;server error: {e}&quot;}, 500 . DELETE Method . This method is used to __ a specific information from the database, again searching by username. | The overall structure stays the same between different databases, but the specific __ will need to be changed to personalize the database. A variable for the username is created in order to search for for the user name requested later in the code with the function find_by_username(). | If the user is found, the user is deleted, along with that user&#39;s data and the change is saved to the database. | If the user isn&#39;t found or if an error is found with the data requested, an __ is returned. | . | . def delete(self): # username variable defined to store requested value username = request.get_json().get(&quot;username&quot;) print(username, &quot;uid&quot;) try: # finds the username and stores data in variable user = find_by_username(username) if user: # if the user is found, the user and their data is deleted db.session.delete(user) db.session.commit() return user.to_dict() else: # if user not found, error is returned return {&quot;message&quot;: &quot;leaderboard not found&quot;}, 404 except Exception as e: # error checking for request error db.session.rollback() return {&quot;message&quot;: f&quot;server error: {e}&quot;}, 500 . Displaying the Full Database . Another class is created in order to __ the entire database at once and also to delete the entire database if necessary. | This uses the same functions as before to GET and DELETE the data, however it is modified slightly to look through the entire database abd display or delete all data points. | An example of where this would be useful is to create a table of data in the __. | . class LeaderboardListAPI(Resource): # GET method def get(self): try: # attempts to find the entire database requested and is stored in variable leaderboards = db.session.query(Leaderboard).all() # sends back the entire database return [leaderboard.to_dict() for leaderboard in leaderboards] except Exception as e: # error checking for request errors db.session.rollback() return {&quot;message&quot;: f&quot;server error: {e}&quot;}, 500 # DELETE method def delete(self): try: # deletes entire database db.session.query(Leaderboard).delete() db.session.commit() return [] except Exception as e: # checks for errors in request db.session.rollback() return {&quot;message&quot;: f&quot;server error: {e}&quot;}, 500 . Popcorn Hacks . Please answer these questions to earn points for the popcorn hacks. . What are the four HTTP request methods that are used with Flask? GET, PUT, POST, DELETE | What is a parser and how would it be aid with data validation? Used to analyze things like string to convert to a purpose. | What is the role endpoints in Flask? They are URI&#39;s to connect to application with request and receive response | Frontend and How it Communicates to Backend . This first part of the frontend logic simply finds out of the site is running locally or not, off of which is figures out whether or not to pull data from the local backend link or the global backend link. In this example, a global backend link hasn&#39;t been sent, however it would go in the second set of quotations after the local address. This isn&#39;t something you need to know, but it is nice to use when developing full stack applications. . // checks if site is run locally const isLocalhost = Boolean( window.location.hostname === &quot;localhost&quot; || window.location.hostname === &quot;[::1]&quot; || window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?: .(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/) ) // defines database url const api = isLocalhost ? &quot;http://localhost:8200&quot; : &quot;&quot;; . GET Method . This method is more complicated in terms of requesting, simply because in order to, for example, print all data points into a __, the function needs to iterate through the entire database. | In this example, the function getList() is used to asynchronously fetch the entire database and set it to a variable called list. The list is returned for later use outside of this __ in order to print the data. | . | . Printing the Data . In order to print the data, the function getList() is run and once it is run, it __ through the data to pull out each individual data point and enter it into the function used to make the table. For each class in the database, which is each row in the database, the variables corresponding to that specific class are pulled and inserted into the addTask() function as __ to create the table of users. | . | The function addTask() is used to create the visual table that the user sees. A row is created and for each table cell in that row, the data is added by iterating through the __ of variables that are parameters pulled directly from the database. | A new row is added into table for each new class of information pulled from the database. | . | . // fetches entire database const getList = async () =&gt; { // stores it in variable list const list = await fetch(api + &quot;/leaderboardList&quot;).then((r) =&gt; r.json()); return list }; // goes through entire database and pulls each individual class getList().then(list =&gt; { // for each class (row), data is pulled and added into addTask() function to be put in visual table list.forEach(cls =&gt; { addTask(cls.username, cls.pointsEasy, cls.pointsMedium, cls.pointsHard) }) }) // adds visual representation of data in table function addTask(username, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard) { // array of variables defining data points var tableCells = [username, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard] // creates new row in variable var row = document.createElement(&#39;tr&#39;) // goes through entire data set and places data into cells for (var i = 0; i &lt; tableCells.length; i++) { var tableCell = document.createElement(&#39;th&#39;) tableCell.textContent = tableCells[i] tableCell.className = &#39;cell&#39; row.appendChild(tableCell) } // creates new row as child of schedule element schedule.appendChild(row) } . POST Method . This method is used to push data to the backend using the __ POST method. The function addData is defined with the parameters that are going to be pushed into the backend. | An object is created to define the variables that are going to be pushed into the backend. This is basically the __ string that will be sent to the backend to get decoded and inserted into the database. | The fetch() function is called with the api variable, which is a variable representing the url for the backend API, and the extension specific to where the data will be posted, in this case being /leaderboard. The method, __, and body of the data are defined in order to complete a successful HTTP request to the backend. The object data which was created earlier, is converted to a JSON string here and sent to the backend. | . | If an error is detected, it is returned and the request will fail. | . | . // calls addData function function addData(username, password, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard){ // creates object defining the variables that will be added to the backend, corresponding with the backend variables let data = { &quot;username&quot;: username, &quot;password&quot;: password, &quot;pointsEasy&quot;: pointsEasy, &quot;pointsMedium&quot;: pointsMedium, &quot;pointsHard&quot;: pointsHard } // POST method called fetch(api + &#39;/leaderboard&#39;, { method: &#39;POST&#39;, headers: { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;, }, body: JSON.stringify(data), }) // error checking .then((response) =&gt; response.json()) .catch((error) =&gt; { console.error(&#39;Error:&#39;, error); }); } . PUT and DELETE Methods . These two methods are almost identical to the POST method above in the way they work, the only difference being that the __ requested is different. The name of the function defined is also changes, in this case being editData() and deleteData(). | . // editing function defined function editData(username, password, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard){ // has object with variables that are required in backend let data = { &quot;username&quot;: username, &quot;password&quot;: password, &quot;pointsEasy&quot;: pointsEasy, &quot;pointsMedium&quot;: pointsMedium, &quot;pointsHard&quot;: pointsHard } // PUT method called fetch(api + &#39;/leaderboard&#39;, { method: &#39;PUT&#39;, headers: { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;, }, body: JSON.stringify(data), }) // error checking .then((response) =&gt; response.json()) .catch((error) =&gt; { console.error(&#39;Error:&#39;, error); }); } . // deleting function defined function deleteData(username, password, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard){ // object defined with variables that are same as backend let data = { &quot;username&quot;: username, &quot;password&quot;: password, &quot;pointsEasy&quot;: pointsEasy, &quot;pointsMedium&quot;: pointsMedium, &quot;pointsHard&quot;: pointsHard } // DELETE method called fetch(api + &#39;/leaderboard&#39;, { method: &#39;DELETE&#39;, headers: { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;, }, body: JSON.stringify(data), }) // error checking .then((response) =&gt; response.json()) .catch((error) =&gt; { console.error(&#39;Error:&#39;, error); }); } . Calling Images (GET Method) . The process for calling images is basically the same as anything else, except you need to be able to reconstruct the images based on the __ that is requested from the backend. | In this case, the image in the api is being called to the frontend and is returned as the variable list. This is then inserted directly into the html by getting the element that needs to be edited and styling with __ by using the built-in function data:image/png;base64, which translated from bytes to pixel. | . | . // GET method calling info from backend url const getList = async () =&gt; { const list = await fetch(api + &quot;/api/images/GetEasyImage&quot;).then((r) =&gt; r.json()); return list }; // inserting image into frontend getList().then(list =&gt; { document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;body&quot;)[0].style = &quot;background-image: url(&#39;data:image/png;base64, &quot; + list.bytes +&quot;&#39;);&quot; }) .

The lesson for time and space complexity of algorithms will consist of demonstrations of sorting algorithms and the different time complexities that they come with on a small scale. This can be acomplished using things such as a deck of cards or even with actual people. An example of how this will work is laying out the cards in a random order on the table, and demonstrating different ways of sorting it. From methods such as bubble sort to methods such as bogo sort, it will be really easy to see exactly how much time it would take for these different sorting algoritms to complete. Then after that, it is easy to understand the concept of time complexity when given a real world example. . Space complexity can be demonstrated by using the same method, however, adding in the extra step of having the cards in a pile. This will show how much space is needed to complete the sorting algorithm. This will easily reveal the concept of space complexity because it allows people to witness a real world, physical example of the concept, turning a really hard to grasp concept into something that is easy to understand. . Additionally, we are also going to analyze certain algorithms within our project to show how such analysis is applicable to real world projects. . Essential Question: What is the quicksort algorithm, and how does it work? How does it&#39;s time and space complexities scale with input sizes? . QuickSort Algorithm . The main algorithm we&#39;ve employed is an recursive implementation of quickSort in the backend to sort the database entries to obtain the user with the highest overall score. Typically this algorithm is implemented to sort in ascending order, but to make it easier to extract the top 10 users, we sill be modifying the algorithm to sort in descending order (so the top players show up first in the list). . class LeaderboardTop10(Resource): def partition(self, arr, lo, hi): pivot = arr[hi][1] # Pivot value set to the 2nd index of the last element pivot_pos = lo - 1 # Set our base pivot position, ensure that lower picoit index == lo for idx in range(lo, hi): # Iterate over all elements in the partition array if arr[idx][1] &gt;= pivot: # Found an element creater than pivot pivot_pos+=1 # Increment correct position for pivot arr[pivot_pos], arr[idx] = arr[idx], arr[pivot_pos] # Swap the larger element with the element at the current pivot position arr[pivot_pos + 1], arr[hi] = arr[hi], arr[pivot_pos + 1] # Swap element at pivot position with the pivot element return pivot_pos+1 # Return index of pivot element def qSortUserList(self, arr, lo, hi): if lo &lt; hi: last_pivot = self.partition(arr, lo, hi) self.qSortUserList(arr, lo, last_pivot-1) self.qSortUserList(arr, last_pivot+1, hi) def get(self): users_list = get_user_list() top10 = {} self.qSortUserList(users_list, 0, len(users_list)-1) for user in users_list: top10[user[0]] = user[1] print(top10) if len(top10) &lt;= 10: return top10 return top10[:10] . To understand how the algorithm first, we must first familiarize ourselves with the process. . Our backend grabs all users from our leaderboard | Returns all users and their scores in a 2-D array, each element is a list of length two that contains the username and cumulative score of the player | The sorting algorithm will use the second element representing the user score to sort the array of users. ┌─────────────────────┐ ┌──────────────────┐ ┌─────────────────┐ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ Split │ │ display │ │ Database │ │ the ├──────────────► sorted list │ │ │ │ List into │ │ on endpoint │ │ │ │ top 10 users │ │ │ └──────────┬──────────┘ └─────────▲────────┘ └─────────────────┘ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ ┌──────────▼──────────┐ ┌─────────┴────────┐ │ │ │ │ │ 2-D User Array │ │ QuickSort │ │ ├───────────────► │ │ [(username, score)] │ │ Algorithm │ │ │ │ │ └─────────────────────┘ └──────────────────┘ . Our quickSort algorithm consists of 2 procedures, a partition() procedure that pivots and sorts individual elements, and a qSortUserList() that performs recursion which finishes the sorting. | The Logic . The partition procedure will serve to &quot;partition&quot; our list into 2 parts, a smaller portion and a larger portion around a certain pivot value (Note: These portions don&#39;t have to sorted yet!). . Partition procedure . First, partition selects a certain element in a list to be a ___. This pivot value will be used to make comparisons to every other value in the array. For simplicity, we have selected our pivot element as the last element in the unsorted list. The procedure defines a pivot_pos variable to denote the correct position of the pivot index after each iteration. Although it may seem weird that the variable intially starts with a value of 0-1 = -1, this negative index is resolved by the return statement, which always returns an index that&#39;s one higher than pivot_pos. This serves to ensure that the lowest pivot index would be 0, which is the smallest element in any given partition. . pivot = arr[hi][1] pivot_pos = lo - 1 . The partition will then iterate over each element in the list from the starting and ending indexes indicated by the parameters. if a particular value is found to be larger than the pivot, the algorithm well then increment the recorded pivot position and swap the pivot with the found element. . for idx in range(lo, hi): if arr[idx][1] &gt;= pivot: pivot_pos+=1 arr[pivot_pos], arr[idx] = arr[idx], arr[pivot_pos] . Finally, the partition procedure swaps the element at the pivot_pos+1 index with our pivot element at the hi index to place the pivot at it&#39;s rightful place. We know that pivot_pos+1 must be smaller than hi because it did not trigger the conditional to increment the `pivot_pos+1`` index. At last, the pivot_pos is incremented and returned to serve as an indicator of where our two partitions split. . arr[pivot_pos + 1], arr[hi] = arr[hi], arr[pivot_pos + 1] return pivot_pos+1 . qSort procedure . If the parition procedure splits our list into smaller and larger regions, then our qSort procedure ensures that these regions are in order. It&#39;s hard to explain, but the procedure iterates over each paritition, repeating the paritition process, setting new pivot values, and correctly places the pivot values at their correct sorted order. . The procedure first checks if the lower index is smaller than the higher index, to ensure that our parition has a length greater than 1. If this check passes, the procedure then calls the partition procedure to both split our list into the two distinct regions and also the index of our correctly placed pivot value. The procedure then invokes itself again on the larger interval (replacing hi to be the partition index-1 since the previous pivot is already sorted), and also on the smaller interval (replacing lo to be partition index+1). . Eventually, the qSort procedure will iterate through all elements in the list while parition places each element at the correct position, giving us the final sorted list. . Complexity analysis . To analyze time complexity, we must analyze the partition and qSort procedures. . For the qSort procedure, because we divide the array into 2 halves during each function call, our number of function calls scales proportionally to ___, where ___ is the length of the input array. However, within each function call, we also call the partition procedure, which contains an for-loop that iterates over each element in the partioned array, comparing it to a pivot value. We are well familiar with since loops, and can safely say that runtime scales proportionally to the length of the partition array. Due to this, we can conclude that our iteration time complexity scales ___. Thus for each iterative process, our timerun scales proportionally to ___. . Finally, we could multiply our two complexities together to get a representation of our overall complexity. Thus, the asymptotic notation for a time complexity could be represented as _, where n is the length of the input array. Keep in mind, Big-Oh notation is not a function that returns the accurate runtime for any given input, but rather only gives us a model to see how runtime scales with increasing input sizes. . Space complexity for this program is much easier to analyze. Because the array is sorted in-place (meaning we don&#39;t create other placeholders or copies), we require no additional space to sort this array. However, recursive function calls may require extra storage on the call stack. Since we found the number of recursive calls to be asymptotic to _, we can conclude that quickSort has an O(1) space complexity for an iterative method, and an O(logn) space complexity for a recursive method. .

Python and API resource definitions are used for RESTful API definitions. Abstraction of Frontend and Backend code, the exchange of standard data format (JSON), and guidelines for exchange (REST) is a technique that saves a lot of time between developers. Learning APIs is a highly recommended step for every developer trying to break into the world of tech. . Covid19: RapidAPI example.
